Release: Vault Integration for Persistent Agent Identity
Version: 2026.9.3
Date: February 25, 2026

OVERVIEW
--------
Major feature release adding HashiCorp Vault integration for persistent storage
of DID keys and Hydra OAuth2 credentials. This solves the critical issue where
pod restarts in Kubernetes deployments resulted in new agent identities and
orphaned Hydra OAuth clients.

PROBLEM SOLVED
--------------
Before this release, when a pod died and restarted:
❌ New DID keys were generated → different agent identity
❌ New Hydra OAuth client was registered → orphaned clients in Hydra
❌ Authentication broke → clients couldn't authenticate with new credentials

After this release, with Vault enabled:
✅ DID keys are restored from Vault → same agent identity
✅ Hydra credentials are reused → no duplicate clients
✅ Authentication persists → seamless pod restarts

FEATURES
--------

1. Vault Client Module (bindu/utils/vault_client.py)
   - Store and retrieve DID private/public keys
   - Store and retrieve Hydra OAuth2 credentials
   - Automatic backup and restore functionality
   - Graceful fallback when Vault is unavailable

2. DID Setup Integration
   - Changed default: recreate_keys=False (was True)
   - Checks Vault for existing keys before generating new ones
   - Automatically backs up newly generated keys to Vault
   - Restores keys from Vault on pod restart

3. Hydra Registration Integration
   - Priority 1: Check Vault for existing credentials
   - Priority 2: Check local filesystem
   - Priority 3: Generate new credentials
   - Automatic backup of credentials to Vault
   - Reuses client_secret from Vault when recreating clients

4. Configuration
   - Environment variables: VAULT__ENABLED, VAULT__URL, VAULT__TOKEN
   - Alternative names: VAULT_ADDR, VAULT_TOKEN
   - Updated VaultSettings with comprehensive documentation

5. Documentation
   - Complete guide: docs/VAULT_INTEGRATION.md
   - Example configuration: .env.vault.example
   - Kubernetes deployment examples
   - Vault setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

6. Testing
   - Comprehensive unit tests: tests/unit/test_vault_integration.py
   - Tests for all Vault operations
   - Mock-based testing for CI/CD compatibility

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

Storage Hierarchy:
vault/secret/bindu/
├── agents/{agent_id}/did-keys
│   ├── private_key (PEM)
│   ├── public_key (PEM)
│   └── did
└── hydra/credentials/{did}/
    ├── client_id
    ├── client_secret
    ├── agent_id
    ├── created_at
    └── scopes

Startup Flow:
1. Check Vault for DID keys → restore if found → generate if not found
2. Check Vault for Hydra credentials → reuse if found → register if not found
3. Backup all credentials to Vault
4. Start agent with persistent identity

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Environment Variables:
```bash
# Enable Vault
VAULT__ENABLED=true

# Vault server URL
VAULT__URL=http://vault:8200

# Vault authentication token
VAULT__TOKEN=hvs.CAESIJ...
```

Kubernetes Example:
```yaml
env:
- name: VAULT__ENABLED
  value: "true"
- name: VAULT__URL
  value: "http://vault.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200"
- name: VAULT__TOKEN
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: bindu-vault-token
      key: token
```

BREAKING CHANGES
----------------
- DID setup default changed: recreate_keys=False (was True)
  - Impact: Existing keys are preserved by default
  - Migration: No action needed, this is the desired behavior
  - Override: Set recreate_keys=True to force regeneration

MIGRATION NOTES
---------------

For Existing Deployments:
1. Enable Vault in configuration: VAULT__ENABLED=true
2. Set Vault URL and token
3. Restart agents - they will automatically backup existing keys
4. Verify keys are in Vault
5. Test by deleting and recreating pods

For New Deployments:
1. Set up Vault (see docs/VAULT_INTEGRATION.md)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy agents - keys will be automatically stored in Vault

Vault Setup:
```bash
# Enable KV v2 secrets engine
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2

# Create policy
vault policy write bindu bindu-policy.hcl

# Generate token
vault token create -policy=bindu -ttl=720h
```

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
- Use Kubernetes auth instead of static tokens in production
- Rotate Vault tokens regularly
- Enable Vault audit logging
- Use TLS for Vault communication
- Never commit Vault tokens to git

PERFORMANCE IMPACT
------------------
- Startup time: +100-200ms for Vault lookups
- Network: Requires Vault connectivity
- Caching: Local files cached after Vault restore
- Failover: Falls back to local files if Vault unavailable

TESTING
-------
✅ Unit tests for VaultClient operations
✅ DID key backup and restore
✅ Hydra credential backup and restore
✅ Graceful degradation when Vault disabled
✅ Error handling for network failures
✅ All existing tests passing
